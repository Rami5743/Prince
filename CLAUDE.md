## The player plays `game.js`, not `src/`

GitHub Pages serves `index.html` and `game.js` from the repository root.
Nothing builds them for you: no workflow, no hook. A fix that is in `src/`
and not in `game.js` does not exist as far as the player is concerned.

This has already happened once, and cost a whole night: six commits of
real fixes sat in `src/` while the player refreshed the page and saw the
same bugs, and reasonably concluded that nothing had been fixed.

`npm run build` now writes both bundles, and `npm test` runs it. So:

* **Never finish a change without `npm test` and `git add -A`.** The
  rebuilt `game.js` and `index.html` have to go in the same commit.
* **Before saying anything is fixed, check `git log -1 -- game.js`**
  against `git log -1 -- src/`. If `src/` is newer, the player has not
  got the fix.

## Work, do not report on work

Do not end a turn with what the next step is. Do the next step. A turn
that spends its time describing a plan, measuring something and then
writing up the measurement has not fixed anything, however good the
write-up. The player wants bugs gone from the game they can play.

Report when something is done and deployed, briefly, and keep going.

## What the port is measured against

A real `PRINCE.EXE` under DOSBox. `tools/oracle/README.md` has the
pipeline and the three measurements it rests on. Where a capture of the
original and a reading of the code disagree, the capture wins.
