## If you know what the next step is, **take it**. Do not write it
## down and hand it back. Do not end a turn with "the next pass
## should...", "what is left is...", "not fixed, narrowed" or a list
## of what you ruled out. Naming the work is not doing the work, and
## the player has had to come back and tell you so again and again.
##
## If you know something is broken and it is not fixed yet, you are
## not finished. Keep going: measure, fix, build, `npm test`,
## `git add -A`, commit, push -- then pick up the next one and do it
## again. Go round that loop until every problem you are aware of is
## solved.
##
## The only thing that ends this is the player telling you, in so
## many words, to stop or to do something else. A measurement you
## took and wrote up has fixed nothing.
##
## ## Running out of room is a problem to solve, not an excuse
##
## "I ran out of context" is not an ending. It is a thing you fix,
## and here is how. The moment you notice the window getting short,
## **write the state down in the repository** and carry straight on:
##
## 1. Put what you have learnt where the next session will find it --
##    the task's own description, `CLAUDE.md`, or a note next to the
##    code. Numbers, not impressions: what was measured, what the
##    score was before and after, which hypotheses are dead and what
##    each one cost.
## 2. Commit and push it. A note that is not pushed does not exist.
## 3. Then keep working. You still have the room you have; use it on
##    the bug and not on prose about the bug.
##
## Written down properly, running out costs the next session nothing
## but the reading. Stopping instead costs the player another round.

## THE JOB IN HAND: close the last of the difference

`src/pop` is a direct translation of https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP
and it is now the game the player plays: `web/main.ts` starts
`PopGame`, and `game.js` carries it. The plan and what was kept is
`docs/sdlpop-translation.md`.

Where it stands, measured by `tools/dev/pop-report.ts` against the
captures of a real PRINCE.EXE:

* the translation draws **11690 of 12036** ticks exactly -- 97 per cent
  -- of the twenty-one runs a capture can settle;
* **the hundred ticks that were "the port's" have been taken apart,
  one run at a time, against fresh captures.** Five were a real fault
  and are fixed: `blitters_2_or` is a bitwise OR of the palette index
  and was drawn as a plain transparent blit, which is the same picture
  over black and a different one over the Prince. The rest are the
  harness, and `tools/oracle/README.md` says which is which, run by
  run and tick by tick.
* four more recordings are captured and kept but no longer counted,
  because their captures measure the emulator's keyboard or the
  original's clock-seeded guard rather than the port. Each one has the
  measurement that says so written beside it in
  `tests/oracle/recordings-vs-original.test.ts`. With them the number
  is 14142 of 16588.
* the hand-written port, which it replaced, is still in `src/game` and
  on `backup/handwritten-port`; nothing but its own unit tests uses it
  now.
* Thirteen of the twenty-one are exact or within one tick. What is
  left is `13ab6867` (156), `0fbffa60` (82), `b4ff4672` (33),
  `9b60bf3a` (28), `760c3e74` (28), `848ee3c4` (14), `palace4` (2),
  `5920a8c2` (2) and `f6874819` (1) -- and `tools/oracle/README.md`
  names what every one of those is. Four of them are a single key
  edge the emulator took a tick or two off the recording's time.

**Before reading any of those as a fault, run
`tools/dev/which-key.ts`.** It moves every key edge of the recording a
tick and two ticks either way and scores each one. The oracle cannot
place an edge to better than a tick, and where the edge decides which
frame of the run `control_running` stops on -- frame 7 or frame 11 --
one tick is thirty of them:

    13ab6867   edge 573 two ticks later:   721 of 728, from 572
    0fbffa60   edge 626 one tick earlier:  714 of 724, from 642
    b4ff4672   edge 251 one tick earlier:  428 of 428, from 395
    9b60bf3a   edge 424 one tick later:    531, from 529
    palace4    edge  20 one tick earlier:  516, from 514
    5920a8c2   edge 240 one tick earlier:  414, from 413

Three edges are 254 of the 346 the suite is short, and `b4ff4672` is
exact once its one edge is where the emulator took it. `760c3e74`'s
is a fifth: the release at 292, taken two ticks early, and the port
draws its ticks 286 to 326 exactly when it is given at 290.

**And recapture.** The oracle's phase moves between captures of the
same recording: four captures of `9b60bf3a` at the same shift, minutes
apart on an idle machine, scored 314, 315, 456 and **529** of its 557
ticks against a port that did not change. `tools/oracle/recapture.sh`
takes a recording several times and keeps the best, and says in its
own comments why that is sound and not fitting the oracle to the port.

### Four things about the oracle, measured the hard way

Read these before calling any difference a fault. Each cost a round.

1. **The schedule is `(t - 1) / 12` for a key going up as well as one
   going down.** Sending a release at `t / 12` instead took the suite
   from 12849 to 6503. `tools/oracle/README.md` has the numbers.
2. **A capture is worth taking four times.** The phase is not the only
   thing that moves: four captures of `9b60bf3a` at the same shift
   scored 314, 315, 456 and 529 of 557 against an unchanged port.
   `tools/oracle/recapture.sh` does this for you. Never read a run of
   differences as a fault until the capture has been taken again.
3. **The capture's phase is not the schedule's.** `origin` has no fixed
   relation to the DOS game's own 12 Hz timer, so every edge of one
   capture lands at the same unknown point inside a tick and at a
   different one in the next. Three captures of `palace4`, same
   recording, same shift, unchanged port: **466, 512 and 428** of 521.
   A run that reads worse after a change may simply be a new capture.
   Capture twice before believing it.
4. **A capture is a fresh run of `PRINCE.EXE`, so the port has to be
   one too.** `g` and the segments' own statics used to carry over, and
   `gate2` scored 235 alone and 616 after the twenty-one recordings
   before it. `resetGlobals` and the three `resetSeg*` fix that; do not
   undo them to make a number look better.

**Do not stop while ticks are still different.** The tools:

* `tools/dev/pop-report.ts [name...]` -- the score.
* `tools/dev/pop-first.ts [name...]` -- where a run first parts
  company, under the same alignment the score uses, so a run that is
  simply a tick or two ahead all the way through is not reported.
* `tools/dev/pop-frames.ts <rec.json> <outdir> <from> <to>` -- the
  translation's frames as PNGs, to put beside the capture's. The
  captures live outside the repository (see `tools/oracle/README.md`);
  `tools/oracle/digests/shifts.txt` says which capture of each
  recording the digest was taken from.
* `tools/dev/recording-trace.ts <rec.json> --all` -- the same run
  through the hand-written port. Where the two ports agree and the
  capture does not, the difference is old; where they disagree, the
  translation has usually dropped a line of the C.
* `tools/dev/short-presses.ts` -- every press in the recordings
  shorter than four ticks, which is what DOSBox takes reliably.
* `tools/dev/late-key.ts <rec> <from> <to> <n,n,n>` -- the same run
  with one press moved on by n ticks, scored.

**Before reading a run of differences as a fault, check for a tap.**
`gate1` looked like the worst difference in the set -- exact for 591
ticks and nothing after -- and it is a two-tick tap of Right that
reached the emulator fourteen ticks late. Moved there, the port draws
790 of the 796. A late press does not read as lateness; it reads as
the original doing something else.

## The player plays `game.js`, not `src/`

GitHub Pages serves `index.html` and `game.js` from the repository root.
Nothing builds them for you: no workflow, no hook. A fix that is in `src/`
and not in `game.js` does not exist as far as the player is concerned.

This has already happened once, and cost a whole night: six commits of
real fixes sat in `src/` while the player refreshed the page and saw the
same bugs, and reasonably concluded that nothing had been fixed.

`npm run build` now writes both bundles, and `npm test` runs it. So:

* **Never finish a change without `npm test` and `git add -A`.** The
  rebuilt `game.js` and `index.html` have to go in the same commit.
* **Before saying anything is fixed, check `git log -1 -- game.js`**
  against `git log -1 -- src/`. If `src/` is newer, the player has not
  got the fix.

## Work, do not report on work

**Nothing runs after you stop calling tools.** A turn ends the moment
you write your final message; there is no background worker carrying on
with what you said you would do next. So "I am continuing" at the end of
a turn is not a plan, it is a stop -- and it has read as one to the
player three times now.

So: never end a turn on what you are about to do. Do it, and end on what
is done and deployed. If a bug needs another measurement, take the
measurement in the same turn. If the context is running out, say so
plainly rather than promising to continue.

A turn that spends itself describing a plan, measuring something and
writing up the measurement has fixed nothing, however good the
write-up. The player wants bugs gone from the game they can play.

## What the port is measured against

A real `PRINCE.EXE` under DOSBox. `tools/oracle/README.md` has the
pipeline and the three measurements it rests on. Where a capture of the
original and a reading of the code disagree, the capture wins.

## Never end a turn by naming the next thing

Do not finish a turn with "what is still missing is X" or "X is the next
big thing". Naming the work is not doing it, and the player has to come
back and tell you to do the thing you just described -- which has now
happened four times.

If you can see what is missing, start it in the same turn. Report what
is done and deployed, and if something really is too big to begin, say
so in one line and say why, not as a plan for next time.

## Stopping is not finishing

If you stop while bugs remain, that is not a finish, it is a pause --
and the only correct thing to do with a pause is start again. Begin the
next turn by picking the work back up, not by summarising where it got
to. Keep going round the loop -- measure, fix, build, commit -- until
every difference against the original is gone. "I ran out of room" is
not an ending either; say what is done and deployed, then carry on.
